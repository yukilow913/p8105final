There seems to be an increasing trend of rat sightings in NYC from 2009 to 2023. 

Trend in rats by borough over time 
```{r}
borough_over_time <- rats_raw %>% 
  group_by(sighting_year, sighting_month_num, sighting_day, borough) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(sighting_year, sighting_month_num, sighting_day, sep = "-"))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(borough))

ggplot(borough_over_time, aes(x = date, y = count, color = borough)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Entries Over Time by Borough",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year") +

From this graph, we can see that Brooklyn seems to have the most rat sightings in NYC. However, we are unable to see the trend in rat sightings in the Bronx. 


```{r}
borough_over_time_wo_brooklyn <- rats_raw %>% 
  filter(borough != "BROOKLYN") %>% 
  filter(borough != "MANHATTAN") %>% 
  group_by(sighting_year, sighting_month_num, sighting_day, borough) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(sighting_year, sighting_month_num, sighting_day, sep = "-"))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(borough))

It seems like the rat sightings in Bronx and Queens are comparable but further EDA is needed to see where the Bronx stands in terms of rat sightings. 

Count of rats by year 
```{r}

  group_by(sighting_year) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sighting_year, y = n, fill = n)) +

  ggtitle('Count of Rat Sightings through the Years') + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = '',colours = rev(brewer.pal(10,'Spectral')))

There was a huge jump in total number of rat sightings from 2020 to 2021. 

Counts of rats by month 
```{r}
by_month <- rats_raw %>% 
  group_by(sighting_month) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sighting_month, y = n, fill = n)) +

  ggtitle('Count of Rat Sightings by Month') + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = '',colours = rev(brewer.pal(10,'Spectral')))

It seems like there are the most rat sightings in the warmer months with the peak being at July. 

Counts of rat by day of the week 
```{r}
by_day <- rats_raw %>% 
  group_by(sighting_weekday) %>%

  ggtitle('Count of Rat Sightings by Day of Week') + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = '',colours = rev(brewer.pal(10,'Spectral')))

There are more rat sighings reported during the weekdays compared to weekends. 

```{r}
